[0.10s - 2.90s] Ilan of you could get up and explain where you are.
[2.90s - 3.70s] How you doing?
[3.70s - 5.20s] And how much wood cutting.
[5.20s - 13.70s] And it's an honor to have these been a tremendously successful guys, is really working so hard and he's got businesses to run.
[13.80s - 16.10s] And in many ways it's a how do you been in this?
[16.10s - 22.30s] And, you know, he sacrificing a lot and take getting a lot of Praise.
[22.30s - 28.60s] I'll tell you but he's also getting hit and we would expect that and that's the way it works.
[28.60s - 31.00s] So I'd like to have Elon Musk.
[31.00s - 32.30s] Please say a few words.
[33.00s - 33.30s] Thank you.
[34.10s - 34.50s] Thank you, mr.
[34.50s - 34.90s] President.
[35.50s - 41.10s] Well, of course of a couple tech support here because this is actually
[41.10s - 46.40s] 
[46.40s - 52.00s] almost a literal description of the work of the protein is doing is helping fix the government, computer systems.
[52.00s - 54.40s] Many of these systems are extremely old.
[54.40s - 58.80s] They don't communicate their lot of mistakes in the systems software doesn't work.
[58.80s - 60.40s] 
[60.40s - 66.50s] The so we actually texted hope it's a, it's ironic but it's true.
[67.80s - 81.30s] The overall goal here with the Doge team is to help address the no more steps that we simply cannot sustain them country to trillion-dollar deficits, the interest rates that just the interest on the national debt.
[81.50s - 89.70s] Now exceeds the defense department spending we spent a lot of impressive public but we're spending like at over two trillion dollars on interest.
[90.10s - 93.60s] If this continues, the country will go to become de facto bankrupt.
[94.00s - 104.90s] It's not an optional thing, it is an essential thing that that's that's the reason I'm here and taking a lot of flak make getting a lot of death threats by the way around, like to stack them up,
[104.90s - 106.50s] 
[106.50s - 110.00s] but if we don't do this America will go bankrupt.
[110.10s - 114.00s] That's why it has to be done confidence.
[114.00s - 116.10s] At this point, knock on wood.
[116.40s - 119.90s] Let them I wouldn't have the, let's go.
[120.10s - 125.70s] One of them that we can actually find a trillion dollars in savings.
[126.00s - 136.50s] That would be roughly 15% of the seven trillion dollar budget and obviously I can only be done with the support of everyone in this room and I'd like to thank everyone for your support.
[136.50s - 137.30s] Thank you very much.
[137.30s - 139.80s] This is this can only be done with what he was important.
[140.90s - 149.90s] So this is is really damaging to support function for the president and for the the agencies and departments to help achieve those of you say.
[150.10s - 156.80s] Savings to effectively, find 15% in production, and fraud, and waste,
[156.80s - 158.30s] 
[158.30s - 159.70s] and every bring the receipts.
[159.70s - 168.90s] So, he also ignores this real, just go to those Dugout we line, item by line item, we specify each item, so and we can, I push it through.
[168.90s - 175.20s] Also, we will make mistakes, we won't be perfect, but when we make, mistakes will fix it very quickly.
[176.10s - 181.40s] So, for example, with usaid, one of the things we do best Suddenly canceled, very briefly.
[181.40s - 183.40s] What is ebola if the road prevention?
[183.40s - 184.80s] I think we all want the goal of prevention.
[185.10s - 189.20s] So we restored, the evolving prevention immediately, and there was no interruption,
[189.20s - 191.10s] 
[191.10s - 193.10s] but we do need to move quickly.
[193.50s - 206.90s] If we're to achieve a trillion dollar deficit reduction in financial year 2026, it requires saving four billion dollars a day, every day from now, through the end of September.
[207.70s - 209.60s] But we can't do it and we will do it.
[210.60s - 210.80s] but,
