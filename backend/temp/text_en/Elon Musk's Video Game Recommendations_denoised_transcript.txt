[1.30s - 3.10s] Can you give me a recommendation, OverWatch?
[3.10s - 7.60s] 
[7.60s - 8.00s] OverWatch.
[8.00s - 9.50s] Has amazing 0, which is amazing.
[9.50s - 11.20s] Yeah, generally blizzard is great stuff.
[11.20s - 13.40s] 
[13.40s - 14.50s] Well, this Hearthstone.
[15.00s - 15.80s] I haven't tried that one yet.
[15.80s - 16.20s] Yeah.
[16.30s - 17.10s] I know people love it.
[17.90s - 18.90s] That's what my kids play.
[18.90s - 20.20s] The most is Hearthstone.
[20.90s - 21.20s] All right?
[21.20s - 23.40s] Also from blizzard, I will check that out tonight.
[24.00s - 24.20s] All right.
[24.20s - 26.40s] Well, thank you very much for the time and I gotta get going cool.
[27.00s - 28.70s] Do you play anything besides which, I mean,
[28.70s - 30.30s] 
[30.30s - 31.40s] we tried a new districts.
[31.80s - 33.40s] I have tried the a Deus Ex the best, okay?
[33.40s - 36.50s] But like, if it's the best game I played recently, it's not a super new game.
[36.50s - 37.30s] Is The Last of Us.
[37.40s - 39.40s] S0, is it really a couple of years ago?
[39.40s - 39.70s] Sure.
[39.70s - 41.10s] I love it.
[41.10s - 42.10s] Okay, Last of Us.
[42.20s - 43.60s] Yeah, you like that, too.
[43.60s - 45.10s] 
[45.10s - 45.90s] There's a really good.
[45.90s - 48.50s] 
[48.50s - 50.20s] Yeah, I've heard good things about Uncharted.
[51.00s - 52.40s] I was just really the last of us.
[52.50s - 53.00s] It's Story Time.
[53.90s - 56.00s] Honestly, I think that that's really neglected.
[56.10s - 66.50s] I mean, that's the criticism of hood of the latest Deus Ex is the story to story telling is kind of lame, like, where is the one, the prior Deus Ex and the original, the original deus ex was the storytelling was amazing.
[66.60s - 69.20s] If anybody's played every to play the original Deus Ex,
[69.20s - 71.70s] 
[71.70s - 72.40s] That was killer.
[73.60s - 77.90s] As games to become more like the replacement for the NFL I think the storytelling just gets generally neglected.
[77.90s - 81.10s] Yeah it's like especially striking to play one that was like absolutely cinematic.
[81.10s - 81.40s] Yeah.
[81.40s - 82.00s] Storytelling.
[83.40s - 86.90s] And some of the oldest games that the graphics and sound were terrible.
[87.10s - 88.70s] So they had to rely on storytelling?
[88.80s - 89.00s] Yeah.
[89.00s - 89.90s] The old Mario games that.
[89.90s - 90.70s] Incredible story.
[90.90s - 91.20s] Yeah.
