[0.30s - 5.20s] You famously said when you were younger, there were five problems that you thought were most important for you to work on.
[5.70s - 9.60s] If you were 22 today, what would the five problems that you would think about working on?
[9.60s - 19.80s] Be well, first of all, I think if somebody is doing something that is useful to the rest of society, I think that's a good thing, like, it doesn't have to change the world.
[19.80s - 35.70s] Like, you know, if you make something that has high value to people, and frankly, even if it's something, if it's like, just a little game, Or you know, the some improvement in photo sharing or something.
[35.70s - 39.70s] If it has, it has a small amount of good for a large number of people.
[39.70s - 46.10s] That's I mean I think that's that's fine like sup doesn't need to be changed the world just to be good.
[46.10s - 57.70s] But in terms of things that I think are most likely to affect the the future of humanity, I think AI is probably the single biggest item in the near term.
[57.70s - 58.80s] That's like the effect.
[60.10s - 60.20s] T.
[60.20s - 66.60s] So, it's very important that we have the Advent of AI in a good way.
[66.70s - 68.60s] That, that is something that
[68.60s - 70.80s] 
[70.80s - 74.80s] if you were, if you could look at the crystal ball and see the future, you would like, you would like that outcome
[74.80s - 76.60s] 
[76.60s - 82.40s] because it is something that could go, could go wrong as we've talked about many times.
[83.20s - 85.80s] And so, we really need to make sure it goes right.
[85.80s - 88.40s] 
[88.40s - 93.30s] That's that's, I think a, I working on AI and making sure it's great future.
[93.30s - 95.60s] That's, that's the most important thing I think right now.
[96.70s - 102.40s] The most pressing item set, then obviously, I think it's through its genetics.
[103.30s - 115.80s] If you can actually solve genetic diseases, if you can prevent Dementia, or Alzheimer's, or something like that, that extragenic reprogramming, that would be wonderful.
[115.80s - 116.60s] So I think this
[116.60s - 118.20s] 
[118.20s - 124.20s] Genetics might be a sort of second most important item I think
[124.20s - 125.70s] 
[125.70s - 128.90s] having a high bandwidth interface to the brain.
[129.00s - 131.20s] Like we're currently bandwidth limited.
[131.20s - 153.00s] We have a digital tertiary self in for very email capabilities that computers phones applications were effectively superhuman but we have extremely bad with constraint in that interface between the cortex and you're sort of that that tertiary digital The form of yourself and helping solve that bandwidth constraint would be.
[153.10s - 154.80s] I think very important for future as well.
