[0.00s - 3.70s] It's like really you're going to work from home and you're going to make everyone else you made your car.
[3.70s - 5.50s] Come work to the fact work in the factory.
[5.50s - 9.60s] You're going to make the people who make your food that gets delivered that they can't work from home.
[9.90s - 17.50s] The you know the people that come fix your house they can't work from home but you can does that seem Marley right?
[18.30s - 19.10s] That's messed up.
[19.20s - 20.30s] You see there's a moral issue.
[20.40s - 23.10s] Yes, it's a productivity issue but it's also a moral issue.
[24.10s - 27.10s] You also get off the goddamn moral high horse with the work from home bullshit
[27.10s - 28.60s] 
[28.60s - 34.10s] because they're asking anyone else to not work from home, while they do the laptop class is living in la-la land, okay?
[34.10s - 36.60s] Look at the cars, but people working from home here.
[36.60s - 37.30s] Of course not.
[37.40s - 46.20s] But in cars servicing, the cars building houses fixing houses, making the food, making all the things that people consume.
[46.20s - 47.80s] 
[47.80s - 52.60s] It's messed up to assume that that this, they have to go to work, but you don't.
[53.60s - 54.50s] How is that?
[54.50s - 58.20s] That is, it's not just a product of anything, I think it's Marley, Marley wrong.
