# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

This document explains the workings behind the scenes of our video dubbing service MVP. The backend is the powerhouse that handles everything from validating input videos and processing them through Google Cloud services to finally producing a dubbed video for the user. Our goal is to clearly outline how all these pieces work together so that even someone without a technical background can see how we ensure the service is reliable, scalable, and secure.

## Backend Architecture

At the heart of our system is a FastAPI-based backend built using Python. This modern framework allows us to create a clear, modular organization of code while providing high performance and ease of scaling. The architecture is designed around simple, well-organized components that manage the flow of data from video upload to final output. We use a step-by-step workflow: first, we validate and extract audio from a video, then process it through speech recognition, translation, and voice synthesis, and finally put together the dubbed video. This modular design means that if we need to add new languages or target integrations later, we can do so with minimal changes to the overall system.

## Database Management

Our backend uses a streamlined approach for managing data. While the project primarily focuses on processing and returning dubbed videos, we incorporate cloud storage solutions like Google Cloud Storage to manage processed videos. This approach ensures scalability without overcomplicating the storage layer. The data related to user interactions, process logs, and error tracking is handled through standard SQL databases, ensuring that the information is safely stored, easily accessed, and maintained over time. This combination offers a balance between performance and reliability as the project scales.

## API Design and Endpoints

Our APIs are designed following REST principles, ensuring that each function has a clear purpose and can communicate easily with the frontend built in React. Key endpoints include one for video uploads where users submit MP4 files or YouTube links, and separate endpoints to manage each stage of the processing pipeline—Speech-to-Text, Neural Machine Translation, and Text-to-Speech. There is also an endpoint dedicated to merging the final audio using ffmpeg, as well as endpoints for fetching processing status updates. This clear separation helps maintain a robust connection between the backend and the user interface while allowing us to update individual services without disrupting the entire system.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend will be hosted on cloud platforms that support Python and FastAPI, ensuring that we can scale up as the number of users grows. By opting for a cloud hosting environment, we gain benefits such as high availability, flexible resources, and cost-effectiveness. This approach means that whether the service is dealing with a low or high volume of traffic, we can adjust our resources to keep performance smooth. The use of cloud-based storage for processed videos further ensures that our service remains reliable and responsive to user needs.

## Infrastructure Components

Several components work behind the scenes to keep our backend running smoothly. Load balancers help distribute incoming traffic evenly, ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed. Caching mechanisms improve speed by storing frequently accessed data for quick retrieval. To deliver content faster to users across different regions, content delivery networks (CDNs) are employed. In addition, essential tools like ffmpeg for audio extraction and merging, and robust logging tools for tracking API calls, directly support the service’s operations. All these pieces work in harmony to ensure that users experience quick responses and consistent service quality.

## Security Measures

Security is a fundamental part of our backend setup. We have implemented strong error-handling practices using try-catch blocks within FastAPI to capture any issues that arise during interactions with third-party services like Google Cloud’s APIs. User inputs are validated rigorously to ensure that only valid MP4 files or acceptable YouTube links are processed. In addition, secure transmission protocols are used for data exchanged between our backend and Google Cloud services, protecting sensitive data during transit. These measures help protect user data and maintain compliance with good security practices.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure that the backend remains healthy and continuously optimized, we integrate robust monitoring tools such as Google Analytics for tracking user interactions and Google Cloud Monitoring for keeping an eye on server performance. Real-time tracking of each stage—from video processing to final output—allows us to quickly identify and resolve any bottlenecks. Regular maintenance routines, including updating libraries and refining API endpoints, are planned so that the service remains up-to-date with evolving user needs and can quickly adapt to technical improvements.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

Our backend is designed to seamlessly manage the entire video dubbing process while being clear, secure, and scalable for future growth. Built with FastAPI and Python, and supported by reliable Google Cloud services and effective error-handling, the architecture is well-suited for the demands of processing video uploads, managing data, and providing real-time feedback. By focusing on a modular design, robust security measures, and efficient hosting arrangements, we ensure that our service not only meets the current requirements of transforming videos but is also prepared to grow and incorporate new features in the future.
