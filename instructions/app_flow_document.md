# Video Dubbing Service App Flow

## Introduction

This application is built as an MVP for a video dubbing service that helps English-speaking content creators expand into the Korean market. The main goal is to allow users to convert their videos – either by direct MP4 upload or by providing a YouTube link – into dubbed Korean versions. The dubbing process involves extracting audio with ffmpeg, using Google Cloud Services such as Speech-to-Text for transcription, Neural Machine Translation for language conversion, and Text-to-Speech for generating the new audio output. The design is simple and minimal, focused on a seamless user experience, ease of use, and real-time feedback on process progress.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

Since the service is open to all users without the need for an account, there is no formal sign-up or sign-in process. When users first access the app, they find a landing page that introduces the video dubbing service. The landing page clearly explains that the service accepts MP4 video uploads or YouTube links featuring videos under 10 minutes. Users are immediately provided with concise instructions on how to use the service without any barriers caused by account creation. Even though there is no login mechanism, users are given clear guidance on how to start the process and what input is expected. In case of any issues, clear error messages guide them and suggest corrective actions.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After arriving at the home page, users are greeted with a clean, intuitive interface that emphasizes simplicity. The page features two clear entry points: one for uploading an MP4 file and another for entering a YouTube link. The page ensures that users understand the constraints on video duration and format. There is also an area dedicated to brief instructions, offering context about processing times and expected outcomes. For users who require assistance or additional context, the page includes descriptive text that explains the flow that follows the initial video input, leading them naturally into the video processing workflow. Navigation from this page is straightforward, as users simply click on their preferred option and are automatically directed to the video validation and processing steps.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user takes action by uploading an MP4 file or entering a YouTube link, the application initiates a series of validation and processing steps. First, the system validates the input, ensuring that the video is in the correct MP4 format and, in the case of YouTube links, does not exceed a 10-minute duration. If the video meets these specifications, for YouTube videos, ffmpeg is triggered to extract the audio stream. The user is then smoothly transitioned to a translation screen where a real-time, segmented progress bar appears. This progress bar clearly communicates each stage by filling a connecting segment as the process advances. The first segment starts with Speech-to-Text (STT), converting the English audio into text. As this stage finishes, the second segment activates to handle text translation from English to Korean using Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Finally, the third segment represents the Text-to-Speech (TTS) process, where the translated text is turned back into Korean audio. During this entire process, textual updates appear below the progress bar to clearly state what operation is being performed, ensuring the user remains informed. Once all processing steps are complete, the system shifts to the result page, where the complete dubbed video is ready for user review.

## Settings and Account Management

Given that the service is accessible without the need to create an account, traditional account management options such as profile settings or billing updates do not exist in this MVP. However, users can interact with the application through feedback mechanisms built into the result page. At the conclusion of the process, users may rate the quality of the dubbing or leave textual feedback. These options allow for future enhancements and iterations, helping the development team improve the experience based on user input. Once a user completes their video processing or submits feedback, they can easily return to the main home page to start a new session or process additional videos. The overall design ensures that navigation between different segments remains smooth and intuitive.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application includes robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience, even when issues arise. If a user attempts to upload a video that does not match the MP4 format or a video that exceeds the 10-minute length limit, the system immediately presents a clear error message on the homepage, prompting the user to correct the mistake. Similarly, if an API call to one of the Google Cloud services fails during the STT, translation, or TTS stages, the backend records the error and returns a user-friendly error notification on the translation screen. These notifications specifically indicate the stage that encountered the problem, such as indicating a failure during text extraction, translation, or audio synthesis. In situations where connectivity issues or unexpected errors interfere with processing, the application not only alerts users but also suggests corrective measures. This design ensures that users are never left confused about the status of their request and are always given a clear pathway to restart or adjust their submission.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

Users beginning their journey with this video dubbing service are greeted by a welcoming, minimalistic landing page that clearly explains their options, whether to upload a video file or enter a YouTube link. From the moment the user selects an input method, the system validates their entry and seamlessly transitions them to the translation interface, where real-time progress updates guide them through the conversion process. Improved by an intuitive progress bar that shows distinct stages for audio transcription, translation, and audio synthesis, the user is kept informed until the final dubbed video is ready. On the result page, users have the opportunity to view, download, and offer feedback on the produced output, ensuring that the process is both transparent and user-focused. Even when errors occur, robust notifications and clear remediation steps ensure that the overall journey remains smooth. The entire application, built using React on the frontend and FastAPI in Python on the backend, is designed with scalability and future enhancements in mind, ensuring that additional languages and greater functionality can readily be incorporated down the line.
